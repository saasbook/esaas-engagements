Feature: a user can be edited

    As an admin user
    So that we can update the user with correct information
    I want to edit a user

Background: Logged in
    And the following users exist:
        | id | name  | github_uid      | email          | user_type     |
        | 1  | user1 | esaas_developer | test@user.com  | coach         |
        | 2  | user2 |                 | test1@user.com | student       |
        | 3  | user3 |                 | test2@user.com | coach         |

    And I'm logged in on the orgs page
    Given I am on the edit user page for user id: "1"

Scenario: There is a form on the edit user page

        | user[github_uid]          | user1git          |
    And I press "Update User"
    Then I should see "User was successfully updated."
