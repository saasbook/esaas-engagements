Feature: after a user logins with their github id they are redirected to the page they wanted to view prior to login

  As a user who first opens the app
  So that I can efficiently login and browse the app
  I want to return to the page I requested to login

Background: users, orgs and apps have been added to database
  Given the following apps exist:
        | name  | description | org_id | status  |
        | app1  | test        | 1      | pending |
        | app2  | test        | 1      | pending |
        | app3  | test        | 1      | pending |

    And the following orgs exist:
        | name | contact_id |
        | org1 | 1          |
        | org2 | 1          |
        | org3 | 1          |

    And the following users exist:
        | id | name  | github_uid      | email          | user_type     |
        | 1  | user1 | esaas_developer | test@user.com  | coach         |
        | 2  | user2 |                 | test1@user.com | student       |
        | 3  | user3 |                 | test2@user.com | coach         |
