Feature: when creating an app, the status dropdown should include all possible vetting status
As a user of the app
So that I should be able to take care of the vetting status for each app
I want to do a string matching within the dropdown menu

Background: user and orgs have been added to database
# The following tables are not needed for the feature, just copied from the original file
  And the following orgs exist:
        | id | name     | contact_id |
        | 1  | Berkeley | 1          |
        | 2  | Stanford | 1          |
        | 3  | org3     | 1          |
        | 4  | org4     | 1          |

  And the following users exist:
        | name              | id | github_uid      | email          | user_type |
        | user1             | 1  | esaas_developer | test1@user.com | coach     |

@javascript
Scenario: I can search the dropdown list of status on new app page (including vetting status options)

  Given I am not logged in
  And I am on the apps page
  And I follow "New App"
  And I am on the login page
  And I follow "Log in with GitHub"
  And I am on the new_app page
  And I press "Create App"
    # id for original (deployment) status
  And I click "#select2-app_status-container"
  And I type in "dec" in ".select2-search__field"
  And I should see "Declined by staff" inside ".select2-results"
  And I should see "Declined by customer" inside ".select2-results"
  And I should see "Declined by customer available next sem" inside ".select2-results"
