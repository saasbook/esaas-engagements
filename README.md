# ESaaS Engagements Tracker

The goal of this currently bare-bones app, thrown together by Armando
Fox, is to do continuous tracking over time of customer apps developed
by the "ESaaS ecosystem" around [UC Berkeley CS169 Software
Engineering](https://cs169.saas-class.org).

The data currently populating the app came from this [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FnllGoYuUjhdF1xF1kQRIrWrv_znxqokSq84-uNw8wY/edit#gid=0).

Since we have had many repeat customers who come back in subsequent
semesters to have a new student cohort enhance an existing app, this
system will track an app's current status over its lifetime as it is
handed off from cohort to cohort.

The main models are:

* App: a deployable Web app.  An app's status may be:
  * `inactive`: not deployed, and/or customer not actively using;
  dormant
  * `development`: in active development, whether or not deployed in
  production
  * `maintenance`: deployed in production, not currently in active development
* Org: a customer organization for whom the app was developed
* User: various subcategories, including developer (e.g. student), coach
(mentor, GSI), customer contact.  Also a principal for authentication,
though as of this writing there's no login/auth support.
* Coaching org: an "organization" whose main function is to provide
mentoring/coaching to students building apps.  E.g., "UCB CS169 Fall 17"
is an org, as is "[AgileVentures](https://agileventures.org)", and so
on.  I would propose that each offering of CS169 be its own org, so we
can track engagements accurately.

An **engagement** is a period of time over which a coach interacts with
developer(s) to work on an app.  During that time, the app is in
`development` status.

After the engagement ends, the app is either in `maintenance` status
(customer is using it; app may be enhanced in future) or `inactive`
(customer not using it, because it doesn't meet their needs enough to be
usable). 

At any given time every app is always part of an engagement, so
engagements have a start date but no end date; an engagement ends when
the app transitions into another engagement.

So for example, an app that is developed in Spring 2017, used by the
customer over the summer, and picked up by another cohort for
enhancements in Fall 2017, might have these engagements:

| Status      | Start date | Coaching org  | Coach      |
|:----------: | :-:        | :-:           | :-:        |
| development | 1/15/2017  | CS169 S'17    | Tony Lee   |
| maintenance | 5/5/2017   | AgileVentures | Sam Joseph |
| development | 8/23/2017  | CS169 F'17    | An Ju      |

# Why?

The goal is to have a robust ecosystem that eventually encompasses not
only UCB CS169 but its offshoots: the AgileVentures volunteer-developer
corps, ESaaS-like courses at other schools (Texas A&M now emulates UCB's
approach and builds software for local nonprofits), etc.

When a new course offering starts, or when a non-course org is looking
to source projects, they can look here to find apps in need of
enhancement; if greenfield apps are built, they can be registered here
so that future dev teams can pick up and enhance them.

# Getting the app running locally

You will need Ruby 2.2.5 and Rails 4.2.6 installed.

Clone the repo, and run `rake db:setup` and then `rake db:seed` to
seed the development database with a subset of the initial data set.
You should then be able to use `rails server` to start the app, and
point your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to access it.

## Logging In (Production)

In production, you login with your GitHub account.  Login is only
permitted for a user whose `github_uid` field in the database is set to
their GitHub username, e.g. `armandofox`.  So, get someone who already
has this field set to set the field for your user record.

## Logging In (Development)

The file `db/github_mock_login.yml` contains the attributes for a fake
user that you can login-as for development work.  You will always be
logged in as the user whose info appears in this file.  **Important:**
You must have run `rake db:seed` to create the fake orgs, apps, and this
user. 

The file `config/application.yml.asc` is an encrypted version of the
file containing the GitHub application key and secret for OmniAuth. 
You shouldn't need to change it, but if you do, get the encryption key
from @armandofox so that you can decrypt, modify, then re-encrypt and
commit `application.yml.asc`.
