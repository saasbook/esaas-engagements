Ed post: https://edstem.org/us/courses/3809/discussion/287862

The problem came from the omniauth-github gem sending access_token via query during the callback phase. After researching around, I found that there was no way to set that other than overriding the specific function of the gem that is responsible for that. 

Since the problem was fairly recent, updating the gem to a newer version did not solve the problem and raised some compatibility issues, so the current version of gem from the golden repo is kept unchanged.  (enjiaxu - Mar 31, 2021)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
